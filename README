This is a group project, where we will

(a) learn the Metapost/Metafont programming language, and
(b) use it to produce sewing patterns.

Next meeting: Thursday 28 Feb at 16:00.
Location: provisionally 36 J 33.

First assignment: work out how to run Metapost and draw some simple
curves.  (Metapost free and included in recent TeX distributions, such
TeXLive.)
